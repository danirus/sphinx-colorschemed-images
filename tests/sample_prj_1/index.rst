.. Sample Project 1 documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Sample Project 1
================

This Sphinx project fails to build because the settings for
sphinx_coloschemed_extension are wrong. Specifically, the setting
``csi_default_color_scheme`` is ``"unknown"`` instead of a value from
the setting ``csi_color_schemes``.
